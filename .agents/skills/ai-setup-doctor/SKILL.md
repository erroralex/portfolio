description: Use when the user asks to check, verify, diagnose, or fix their AI assistant setup, e.g. "check my AI setup", "is my agent setup working", "run the setup doctor", "why doesn't Claude see my skills / my instructions / my rulebook". Also use after cloning a repo that uses AGENTS.md + .agents/skills onto a new machine, or whenever instructions or skills appear not to load. Runs a concrete checklist over the project's instruction files, shims, and skill links, then reports pass/warn/fail with a copy-pasteable fix for every failure.

# AI setup doctor

Verify that a project assembled from the AI starter kit actually loads its
instructions and skills. Every check below is a file check you can run with your
own tools; no scripts to install. The setup fails *silently* when broken (the
assistant just behaves generically), which is why this checklist exists.

Run read-only. Propose fixes; apply one only after the user confirms. Never
rewrite `AGENTS.md` content beyond the `## Project` header placeholders, and only
when the user supplies the real values.

## Scope

Check exactly one project: the nearest directory at or above the working
directory that contains `AGENTS.md` or `CLAUDE.md`. Never scan sibling or
parent directories for other projects. If the working directory is not inside
a project (e.g. a folder of repos), ask the user which project to check; do
not pick one or check several.

## Report format

Always finish with this exact structure; a table, then a one-line verdict:

```
| Check | Status | Fix |
|---|---|---|
| AGENTS.md present | PASS | none |
| Project header filled | WARN | give me your build/test/run commands and I'll fill them in |
| .claude/skills resolves | FAIL | New-Item -ItemType Junction .claude\skills -Target (Resolve-Path .agents\skills) |
...

Verdict: 2 problems; instructions load, but Claude Code cannot see your skills.
```

Every FAIL row carries a command the user can paste as-is (match their OS).
WARN means "works, but degraded or non-portable"; explain the consequence in the
verdict, not the table.

## The checklist

Run all checks even after the first failure; the user wants the full picture.

1. **`AGENTS.md` exists at the project root.** Missing → FAIL; fix: copy
   `starter-kit/base/AGENTS.md` from the kit and re-run assembly
   (the kit's `handbook/04-new-project.md` is the full procedure).

2. **`## Project` header is filled in.** The Name/Build/Test/Run lines must not
   contain `<...>` placeholders. Placeholders → WARN: an assistant that can't run
   the real test command can't verify anything it builds. Fix: ask the user for
   the real commands and offer to fill them in.

3. **`CLAUDE.md` exists and contains a line `@AGENTS.md`.** Extra content is
   allowed; the import line is what makes Claude Code load the rulebook (it does
   not read a bare `AGENTS.md`). Missing → FAIL; fix: create `CLAUDE.md`
   containing exactly `@AGENTS.md`.

4. **`.claude/skills` exists and resolves.** Inspect it:
   - Windows: `Get-Item .claude\skills | Select-Object LinkType,Target`
   - macOS/Linux: `ls -l .claude/skills`
   - A junction/symlink pointing at `.agents/skills` → PASS.
   - A real directory with skills inside → WARN: valid (this is the kit's
     mouse-only layout) but only Claude Code sees these skills; the portable
     layout is `.agents/skills/` + link.
   - Missing, or a link whose target doesn't exist → FAIL; fix:
     - Windows: `New-Item -ItemType Junction .claude\skills -Target (Resolve-Path .agents\skills)`
     - macOS/Linux: `ln -s ../.agents/skills .claude/skills`
     (remove the dangling link first if there is one).

5. **Every skill is readable.** Each directory under the resolved skills path must
   contain a `SKILL.md` whose frontmatter has `name` and `description`. A dir
   without one → FAIL for that skill; fix: re-copy it from the kit's
   `starter-kit/skills/`.

6. **`.agents/skills/` exists** (the assistant-agnostic home). Skills living only
   in `.claude/skills` → WARN: Copilot/Codex/other assistants won't find them;
   fix: move to `.agents/skills/` and link as in check 4.

7. **`.claude/settings.json` parses as JSON** (if present). Invalid → FAIL with the
   parse error. If valid, advisory: compare its `permissions.allow` entries with
   the Project header's build/test commands; a header saying `./gradlew build`
   while the allowlist only covers `./mvnw` means permission prompts on every
   build; suggest the matching entries.

8. **`GEMINI.md` is identical to `AGENTS.md`** (if present). Compare byte-for-byte
   (`fc.exe AGENTS.md GEMINI.md` / `cmp -s AGENTS.md GEMINI.md && echo same`).
   Drift → FAIL: the two assistants are following different rules, which is
   miserable to debug; fix: re-copy `AGENTS.md` over `GEMINI.md`.

9. **`.gitignore` covers the link.** If `.claude/skills` is a junction/symlink,
   `.gitignore` should contain `.claude/skills/` so the linked content isn't
   committed twice. Missing → WARN; fix: `Add-Content .gitignore ".claude/skills/"`
   / `echo ".claude/skills/" >> .gitignore`.

10. **Addons match the project** (advisory only; never edit). Compare the tech
    sections appended to `AGENTS.md` against the evidence on disk: `pom.xml` or
    `build.gradle` → expect a Spring Boot section; `package.json` with `vue` or
    `@angular/core` → expect the matching frontend section;
    `src/main/resources/templates/` → expect Thymeleaf. Report mismatches
    (missing or leftover sections) as WARN with a pointer to the kit's
    `starter-kit/addons/`.

## Live smoke test

The file checks prove the wiring; this proves the load. You can self-verify:
quote the `**Name:**` line of the `## Project` header *from your own loaded
instructions* (not by reading the file), and list the skills your harness
provides, comparing them against the directories on disk from check 5. If you
cannot quote the header, `CLAUDE.md` isn't loading; if skills are missing from
your list, the link from check 4 is broken; even if the files look right.

To verify a different assistant or a fresh session, give the user this probe:

```
claude -p --model haiku "Quote the Project Name line from your instructions and list every skill available to you."
```

Pass = the reply quotes the exact project name and names every skill directory
present on disk (count them). A generic answer means instructions aren't
loading; a partial skill list means the link or a copy is broken.
